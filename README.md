For this project, I extend Project #1 in two distinct ways. 
1)I enable my client and server to communicate using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) instead of sockets. I look into and leverage Java RMI for RPC communication.
2) I make it possible that RPC functions can be called concurrently, consequently, I also handle mutual exclusion.
